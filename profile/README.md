Global.health is a transformative initiative dedicated to creating a state-of-the-art, secure data and analytics platform that empowers pandemic and epidemic research and supports equitable public health decision-making worldwide.

We build networks, software, and analytical tools that are open-source, easily deployable, and co-designed by our global teams.

Our mission is to enable rapid sharing of trusted public health data to advance the response to infectious diseases.
