First of all, thank you for choosing to contribute some of your time to the Global.health. You rock! :guitar:

Here are a few guidelines to help you understand the project, learn about the style guide, development best practices, how to write your first PR and make the world a better place.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/globaldothealth/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## What can you contribute to?

Global.health contains multiple projects. Depending on your area of expertise you might want to start with looking for issues within repositories relevant to your skills.

Technologies used include: Node.JS/Typescript, MongoDB, React, and Python.

## Report issues

A very good way to contribute is to report issues, either found when working on a PR or when simply using Global.health. We have issue templates to help you report feature requests or bugs, please use them when reporting an issue.

## Developer documentation

The documentation for devs can be found in each repository.

It should contain all the necessary information to run a full stack locally.

We use the [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for development. You should always have a working `main` branch and features being developed in parallel branches then merged into `main`.

## Improvements 

New feature / field / style request maybe made by raising an issue, adding an appropriate label and assigning it to @outbreakprepared.

Your suggestion would be reviewed and you would be notified when a decision is reached with next steps.

## Testing

We have numerous github actions that run on every PR and push to the `main` branch. Make sure your PR actions are green before requesting a review. We also protect the `main` branch so reviews are required, you will not get an approval if the actions are not passing so please, add and fix tests whenever possible.
